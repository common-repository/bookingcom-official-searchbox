The official Booking.com search box is a user-friendly, customisable plugin to add the Booking.com search box to your own website in two easy steps.

== Description ==

This plugin creates a search box that Booking.com Affiliate Partners can implement into their site using their affiliate ID.

If you’re not an Affiliate Partner yet, you can still implement the plugin. To get the most out of the plugin and earn commission, you’ll need to sign up for the [Booking.com Affiliate Partner Programme](http://www.booking.com/content/affiliates.html).

To implement the search box, simply drag and drop the plugin to the sidebar Widget area to publish it - then you’re done!

Once installed, you can choose a pre-filled destination for the search box. This destination is linked to a destination ID, avoiding potential issues for multiple cities with the same name. You can also change the pre-filled destination for each page or post where the search box is displaying, thanks to the meta box feature showing at the end of the editing area.

You can even customize the colour, text, and size of the search box to fit your website design. Check the Features for more details.
